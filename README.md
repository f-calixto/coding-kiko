Hi!

My name is Francisco, I am a software developer from Brazil, living in Uruguay.
I work mostly with technologies related to backend web development but enjoy exploring other technologies too.

Most of the work you can find in my repositories are side projects made with the intention of learning and having fun, you may find a lot of bad practices and room for improvement.
